After elves at his factory threatened to unionize, Santa released a zombie virus. 
Since Santa has degrees in sleigh piloting and present delivery but not in business management, 
he failed to realize that this would only encourage the elves to unionize. 
Now unionized and zombified, the elves go on strike to protest the poor sanitation at the factory. 
Because they are zombies, the elves have developed excessive aggression and a taste for flesh.
Realizing the danger he is in, Santa flees with the only remaining non-zombie reindeer.

Zombies will pursue you as you attempt to escape. 
They will rush you and damage your sleigh, but will kill themselves in the process.
Kill zombies and avoid obstacles while you make it as far away from the factory as you can.
